The Cambridge Tübingen meeting is a retreat for all current members of the [Cambridge Tübingen Program](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/?page_id=1458) to get together and brainstorm about potential joint research projects. It takes place in a remote location to block out all potential distractions and create an intimate and stimulating atmosphere. Besides fostering friendship and and the CamTue community, we expect the meeting to initiate collaborations on concrete research projects.

We invite one or two renowned speakers to provide inputs and spark stimulating discussions on a specific topic. In this first CamTue meeting from 20 - 24 November 2017 in Mallorca, we are happy to welcome [James Hensman](http://jameshensman.github.io/) as an invited speaker, who will join us for part of the workshop.
